This experience will serve as a strong foundation for me to pursue advanced roles in data science and AI fields, allowing me to make a substantial impact on businesses through data-driven strategies.

## answer for question 3
Describe a machine learning project you've worked on that you are proud of. What was it about? What were the challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?
- One machine learning project that I am particularly proud of is when I analyzed student activity in a Computer Programming course. The project involved predicting students' final scores by implementing various models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. One of the main challenges I faced was feature engineering to extract relevant information from student activity data accurately. To overcome this challenge, I extensively researched best practices in feature selection and engineering, experimenting with different combinations to enhance model performance. Ultimately, through iterative refinement and validation processes, I achieved a significant improvement in predicting students' final scores with an absolute difference of 5 points, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach taken. This project reinforced my problem-solving skills, resilience in the face of challenges, and the ability to deliver actionable insights through machine learning techniques.
